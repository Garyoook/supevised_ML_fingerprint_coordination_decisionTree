## Set up the environment:
In your terminal:

First run `python3 -m venv venv` to create virtual environment.

Run `source venv/bin/activate` to enter the virtual environment

make sure you see `(venv)` displayed

Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install packages needed (matplotlib and numpy for implementation,
 texttable for formatting print-out result)

## Generate the decision tree and run evaluation:
To **generate** decision tree of the your dataset, run code below: 
Running this will print out the basic structure of generated decision tree.
`python3 dt.py <path_to_dataset> `

example: generate a decision tree from clean_dataset.txt:
`python3 dt.py wifi_db/clean_dataset.txt `



To **evaluate** the decision tree generated by your dataset, run code below: 
Running this will print out full evaluation analysis based on the decision tree generated from target dataset.
`python3 evaluate.py <path_to_dataset>`

example: evaluate decision tree generated from clean_dataset.txt:
`python3 evaluate.py wifi_db/clean_dataset.txt`

## Pruning:
To **prune** the decision tree generated by the clean dataset, run code below:
Running this will print out analysis in the procedure of pruning the generated decision tree from target dataset.
`python3 pruning.py <path_to_dataset>`


example: To prune the decision tree generated by the noisy dataset, run:
`python3 pruning.py wifi_db/noisy_dataset.txt `

## Visualisation:
To visualise the trained decision tree of a selected dataset, 

run `python3 visualise_dtree.py <path_to_your_dataset> <save_name>`, save_name is an optional argument.

You will see the complete image of the decision tree generated, if it is not compatible to view on your screen,
open the png file named _<save_name>.png_ in folder _tree_images/_. if you typed in customized name or _decision_tree_default.png_ by default
generated in the project directory using the system image viewer.
